\chapter{Static vs Singleton}

Both patterns are used to ensure that there is only one instance of a class or a set of shared resources.

\section{Static}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loaded when the class is loaded and remain in memory until the lifetime of the application
\end{itemize}

\section{Static}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loaded when the class is loaded and remain in memory until the lifetime of the application
\end{itemize}

\section{Singleton}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensures only one instance is created
    \item Instance is created once and lives until the end of the application, unless manually destroyed

    \begin{lstlisting}
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor prevents instantiation
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

Singleton instance = Singleton.getInstance(); // Same instance every time.

    \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
