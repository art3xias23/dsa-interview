\chapter{Dependency Injection}

\section{Singleton}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Only one instance is available throughout the lifetime of the application
		\item Good for services which don't need to be recreated and can share their state
		\item Use cases
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Configuration objects
			\item Logging services
			\Database connection pools
			\Caching mechanisms
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\section{Scoped}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Created once per request and disposed when the request ends.
		\item Use cases
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Entity Framework DbContext
			\item Services which track session data
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\section{Transient}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Created \textbf{each time it is requested}
		\item Ideal for lightweight, stateless objects
		\item Use cases
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Data Transformers, Validators, Mappers
			\item Short-lives services which need to be frequently created
		\end{itemize}
