# latex-journey

Recently I was in a position where I had to look for a job after 7 years. Initially it was a bit difficult as I had forgotten much of the basics, despite using them often. 

I also interviewed for a big firm which showed me that I was lacking in System Design knowledge.

Some other interviews showed me that I was also a bit slow in doing logic excersices.

I told myself "No More!"

This repository will be just that. A new journey in my life. A journey which will be comprised of two parts, that will run simultaneously (not concurrently).


- I will compile much of the generic theoretical interview questions.
- I will put my findings on Data Structures and link them to Leetcode questions.l

The current goals will be: 

- Gain the knowledge of often seen interview questions.
- Familiarize myself with data structures.
- Gain an approach to think about and solve leetcode questions.
- Understand system design and how to approach questions related to it.

This is very exciting for me. I've given myself 6 months to a year to be fully prepared. Let's see where this takes me!
