\chapter{Two Pointers}

\section{Explanation}

Having two pointers pointed at different parts of a string or an array. The pointers move from start and end closer to each other. Or they can move in the same direction

\section{When to use}
When we need to compare an element against other elements

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparing elements from two ends: Like checking for palindromes or finding pairs in a sorted array.
\item searching for a target sum or condition. In \textbf{"Two Sum"} where we need two numbers which meet a condition
\item Removing duplicates from sorted arrays
\item Finding subarrays like in \textbf{"Sliding Window"} problems
\end{itemize}	

\section{Example questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array
\item Reverse String
\item Move Zeroes
\end{itemize}
